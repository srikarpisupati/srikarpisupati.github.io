## Hello!

My name is Srikar, and I am a CS student from the Bay Area. I’m an eager learner and I love building tech that solves real-life problems.

I've worked with a variety of languages, including C++, Python, Java, and Swift. I am currently working on an app to help users decide how to make the most fair and efficient allocation for a group of resources. I'm interested in learning about complex networks and machine learning systems that help people automate processes and make decisions.

In my free time, I love traveling, playing basketball with my friends, making music, and watching movies :)
