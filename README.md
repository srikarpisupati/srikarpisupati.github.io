Hello!

My name is Srikar, and I am a CS student from the Bay Area. Iâ€™m an eager learner and I love building tech that solves real-life problems.

I've worked with a variety of languages, including C/C++, Python, Java, and Swift. I'm interested in learning about complex networks and machine learning systems that help people automate processes and make decisions. 

I love traveling, playing basketball with my friends, making music, and watching movies :)
